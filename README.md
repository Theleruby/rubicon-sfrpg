# Rubicon for Starfinder

Rubicon is an extension module for Foundry VTT which is designed to improve the Starfinder roleplaying experience. It was developed over a number of 'combat test' sessions that I performed with my brother prior to us starting our Starfinder roleplaying adventure.

Rubicon adds features such as:
- A new heads-up display for players which is shown above the macro bar, displaying their AC, speed, hit points, stamina, resolve, equipped weapons, free spell slots, and any status conditions they might have
- Definitions for many common actions not supported out of the box (such as creating a dedicated Harrying Fire action)
- Quick action menu that allows you to easily perform common actions without having to open the character sheet. Examples of things supported are: attacking, equipping/unequipping weapons, casting spells, using consumables, rolling skills, or performing one of the newly supported common actions.
- Bug fixes and workarounds which are hacky and not really suitable to go into the sfrpg core

The highest priority of Rubicon is to streamline combat encounters, both for the GM and the players. New features will be added as and when they are needed to help achieve this goal.

To use this module you will require:
- Foundry VTT version 12
